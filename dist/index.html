            <p>"Viento en Contra" began as a group of friends who gathered in the afternoons to play music. In 1994, their main
            inspiration was to perform covers of other bands, alongside original songs. The members at that time were Francisco
            "Pancho" Cabrera, Javier Ortiz, and Edgar "el Puma" Pereira, two guitarists and a drummer.</p>

            <p>The following year, in 1995, they began performing their first shows. The acts were simple and modest, yet symbolic for
            the band. At that time, they did not have an established name, nor permanent members. The only thing they were certain
            of was the need for one more member.</p>

            <p>"Casino," released in 2009, contains the song called "Tiembla el Suelo", which makes a comparison of the feeling of
            jealousy a person experiences. The lyrics, with phrases like "The ground shakes because I look at you without wanting
            to" and "Love without jealousy was never given by heaven", express the inner conflict and the jealousy that accompany
            love.</p>
